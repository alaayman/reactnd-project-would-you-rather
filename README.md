## What i did

- I used create-react-app installed redux, react-redux, thunk, logger,react-router-dom and bootstrap
- Created the components
- Created the async functions to get data from the \_Data.js file and add it to the store
- started connecting components and populate it with data using mapStateToProps
- Dispatched my actions using mapDispatchToProps
- And started debugging mistakes find how \_Data function works
- Had a problem with \_Data functions thought they return all modified state objects it took me a while to notice and make the necessary code at actions and reducers to update the store correctly
